<h3>A: Silver fillings can be replaced with white tooth fillings</h3>Many persons have had silver fillings placed into their teeth because they had <q>cavities</q>. These silver fillings are called amalgams.  Amalgam fills the space where the decay in the tooth has been removed.<br /><br />However, over time, the amalgam corrodes and leaks which blackens the silver, and many times the tooth. This is easily seen as soon as a patient opens his or her mouth and is usually a source of embarrassment for the patient.<br /><br />A cosmetic dentist can provide  you with composite fillings that are made of a porcelain-like material that actually bonds to the tooth for a tight seal. They are strong and stain-resistant, in addition they are color-matched to the natural tooth, making them <q>invisible</q>.<br /><br />Composite fillings also lack the sensitivity that is often associated with silver amalgam fillings. They are especially suited for smaller cavities and for our patients who may be allergic to metal fillings.<br /><br />Please don't hesitate to call a qualified cosmetic dentist. Just enter your zip code above, and our contact information will be readily available specific to your area.  You may call or visit with any questions you may have about the benefits of replacing silver amalgam fillings with invisible composite fillings. <h3>Q: I would love a brighter smile, what do you offer to whiten  teeth?</h3><h3>A: Discolored, dark or stained teeth fixed with tooth whitening dentistry</h3>Tooth bleaching involves the placement of a bleaching solution on the teeth to eliminate stains and discoloration. The solution is held in place by a custom-made, see-through tray that fits over the teeth - much like a mouthpiece worn by a professional boxer. <br /><br />Bleaching is a safe, effective and relatively easy means of producing a whiter smile.<br /><br />Two bleaching methods are available by cosmetic dentists: Power Bleaching with a Laser, done in office, and At-Home-Bleaching, which provides for home use (not to be confused with over-the-counter bleaching products available in local drug stores). <br /><br />The difference between the two is the strength of the whitening agent and the time it takes to get effective results.  Power bleaching usually takes three to six visits, while home bleaching may take up to four weeks of regular use.<br /><br />Sensitive teeth, or those that are chipped, eroded or weakened by cavities, should be repaired or protected before they are bleached.<br /><br />Please don't hesitate to call a qualified cosmetic dentist pre-selected for you within our database with any questions you may have about the benefits of tooth whitening or tooth bleaching for a whiter smile.<h3>Q: I have some uneven and cracked teeth, Is there a simple solution to fix this?</h3><h3>A: Broken teeth are comfortably repaired through cosmetic dental bonding</h3>Bonding by a cosmetic dentist is typically painless and can yield dramatic results in a single office visit.  Essentially, bonding hides any natural flaws through the placement of a thin plastic coating on the front surface of the teeth.<br /><br />After treating the tooth surface, your cosmetic dentist will then apply a puttylike bonding material that is then sculpted, shaped and colored to suit your needs. A high-intensity light causes the plastic to harden after which the new surface is smoothed and polished.<br /><br />Bonding can lighten stains, close gaps and even alter crooked or malformed teeth. One of our cosmetic dentists can even utilize it to change the shape or color of a single tooth or if necessary to remake your entire smile.<br /><br />Please call one of our qualified cosmetic dental offices for a cosmetic consultation.<h3>Q: I really do not like my smile, What would be the best to redesign my smile?</h3><h3>A: Porcelain veneers and your smile</h3>Cosmetic dentists frequently uses porcelain veneers for the same reasons as bonding (to lighten stains, close gaps and even alter crooked or malformed teeth).  They are considerably more durable and stain resistant than bonding.<br /><br />The veneer is actually a thin piece of porcelain similar in size to a fingernail.  Once it is "bonded" onto the tooth it becomes extremely strong.  Your cosmetic dentist will then also blend the veneer in with the remaining tooth structure so that it is unnoticeable to the naked-eye.  Once in place, it looks, feels, and functions just like a regular tooth.<br /><br />Porcelain veneers are used to change the shape and color of a single tooth or if necessary, revamp an entire smile.  Porcelain veneers can also be used to correct teeth that have been worn from clenching and grinding.<h3>Q: I am terrified of the dentist, but I need work done - How can you help me?</h3><h3>A: We offer Sedation Dentistry!  How does it work?</h3>You are given a small pill to take an hour prior to your dental appointment. Your companion will accompany you to the office. By the time you arrive you will be very drowsy. <br /><br />When you arrive in our office, you will be escorted into the comfort room, covered with a thick, warm blanket and placed on a monitor to watch your vital signs. After you are comfortable your cosmetic dentist and his/her experienced clinical team will take care of your dental needs. <br /><br />When your treatment is completed your companion will return you home to finish your comfortable, relaxing day.<div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><div align="center">
