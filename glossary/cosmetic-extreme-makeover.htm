Cosmetic dentistry is a crucial part of an Extreme Makeover. Improving your smile can be one of the easiest ways to improve your appearance. A great smile not only looks great but also makes you feel confident.<br /><br />Hold a mirror to your face and smile. What do you notice? In considering cosmetic dentistry it is important to look at three things: bite, gums, and teeth. Cosmetic dentistry can improve and maintain your bite. Think about your gums. Are they healthy, well-colored, and adequately frame your teeth? Also, look at your teeth. Do you have fillings? Are your teeth discolored from coffee or smoking? Are your teeth poorly shaped with chips and cracks?<h3>Extreme Makeover Dentist Options</h3>Extreme Makeover Dentist may target your bite, gums, and teeth to not only improve the look of your smile but also help to maintain your teeth and gums. Cosmetic dentistry may use bonding to restore the shape and size of your teeth. Gum reshaping can help to reframe your teeth. Chips and cracks can be erased with filling and reshaping the teeth. Those stains can also be erased and your teeth given a refreshed pearly white color!<br /><br />You have several options in choosing different procedures from full-mouth reconstruction to smaller procedures targeted on specific problems like tooth discoloring. Look at the procedures available and determine what kind of smile you wish to have.<br /><br />Technology can help you to choose what cosmetic dentistry you are looking for. Digital cameras and computer imaging can allow you to visually see the effect of the procedures you are considering. A picture of your existing smile is taken and then placed on the computer monitor. A program then simulates different procedures, altering your smile with reshaping and reconstruction. Using the computer in such a way, allows you to design your smile and get an idea of the outcome of cosmetic dentistry procedures.<h3>Extreme Makeover Dentist - Procedures</h3>Extreme Makeover Dentist offers several procedures that can help you improve the quality and look of your smile. <br /><br />A common problem among those considering cosmetic dentistry is stains on the teeth. The simplest and least expensive way to brighten the color of your teeth is through Teeth Whitening or Teeth Bleaching. It can be done at home or in a dentist office. When done well, teeth whitening can last for five years if the patient avoids things that overly stain teeth such as coffee and smoking. Touch-ups to teeth whitening are recommended.<br /><br />Often from common wear and tear, teeth have chips and cracks. Cosmetic dentistry can easily fix these common problems and not only enhance your smile but ensure your teeth stay healthy.<br /><br />Bonding is a procedure in cosmetic dentistry that is used to fix chips or fill gaps. Bonding is achieved by applying a type of thin white-colored plastic to the outside of the teeth. As technology has advanced, there are now more options than simple bonding.<br /><br />Porcelain veneers are one of the more popular procedures. A thin porcelain shell is bonded to the front of the teeth. Unlike conventional bonding there is very little chance of discoloration. Porcelain veneers are highly resistant to coffee and cigarette stains. The procedure is also quick and painless. Not only do porcelain veneers help in teeth staining, they also can mask chips in the teeth. They are also easy to maintain with brushing and flossing everyday. Similarly, porcelain crowns can be used. Unlike veneers, a crown covers the entire tooth. Porcelain or Ceramic crowns are a good alternative if there is more structural damage to your teeth such as cracks and larger chips.<br /><br />Porcelain Onlays and Inlays are another procedure to consider. Onlays and Inlays are a good option for restoration of teeth. They are effective in particular for fixing the back area of your teeth. An Onlay covers all points while an Inlay is similar to a filling. Both the Onlay and Inlay are formed from a composite resin. This resin is tooth colored and painlessly bonded to the tooth. The resin structurally reinforces the tooth ensuring your smile lasts for a long time.<br /><br />In general, tooth color fillings made of resin are a good choice for reinforcing the structure of your teeth. Crowns are also a good idea. The crown, made of porcelain, ceramic or fused metal, acts like a cap that holds the tooth together if it is cracked or decaying.<br /><br />Cosmetic dentistry can also easily solve gaps that may appear in the teeth. This is termed <q>fixing bridges</q>. The procedure involves replacing natural teeth that are missing. Such dental implants can easily solve the problem of missing teeth. The procedure involves directly placing the implant into the jawbone, acting like a natural tooth root. The tooth is usually made of metallic or a bonelike ceramics that easily blends with other surrounding teeth. The implant is extremely permanent and stable. A custom framework then directly fits over the bone ensuring stability. Dental implants have a 95% success rate.<br /><br />For some, an extreme makeover includes dentures. Dentures are reserved for cases where the teeth are in an advanced stage of decay and there are several gaps to the teeth. Full mouth reconstruction is often chosen as the best option. Dentures can be custom made and fitted to match the size and shape of your smile.<br /><br />Please see on main site for cosmetic dentist in your area that can assist you get a extreme makeover smile.<div class="clear"></div><br /><br /><br /><div align="center">
