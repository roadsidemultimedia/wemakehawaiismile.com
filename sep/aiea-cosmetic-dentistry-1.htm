<h1>What is Cosmetic Dentistry? </h1>
<p><img src="../images/cosmetic-dentistry.jpg" alt="Honolulu porcelain veneers" class="left" />Cosmetic dentistry can restore your teeth back to their original appearance and usefulness. Even some of the most conservative changes can have a big impact.</p>
<p>Procedures such as tooth whitening, porcelain veneers and tooth shaping can be very affordable and easy ways to give your appearance a boost.</p>

<h3>Porcelain Veneers</h3>
<p><img src="../images/porcelain-veneers-1.jpg" alt="Honolulu Japanese Dentist" class="left" /><img src="../images/porcelain-veneers-2.jpg" alt="porcelain veneers Aiea" class="left" />Porcelain veneers are very durable, stain-resistant shells of procelain that are placed over your natural tooth surface. They can instantly change the appearance of cracked, chipped or badly stained teeth.</p>
<p>The procedure involves removing a small amount of your natural tooth surface, and your porcelain veneers will be bonded over this surface. Because your natural teeth are altered, this procedure is permanent. Because your veneers will be color matched to your own teeth, the usual procedure is to whiten your teeth first and than color match your veneers.</p>


<h3>Tooth whitening</h3>
<p><img src="../images/teeth-whitening-1.jpg" alt="Honolulu cosmetic dentistry" class="left" /><img src="../images/teeth-whitening-2.jpg" alt="porcelain veneers Honolulu" class="left" />Tooth whitening is often the first procedure your cosmetic dentist will recommend since it is often necessary to have this procedure done before your dentist can move on to other treatments. There are many options for whitening your teeth today but in-office your dentist will usually use two different ways.</p>
<p>Laser whitening is an in-office procedure. Bleaching gel is applied to the surface of your teeth and a laser light is used to activate it. The effects from laser whitening are often dramatic. It can whiten your teeth up to 9 shades whiter, depending on the degree of staining, usually in 1 hour.</p>
<p>You may also chose to whiten your teeth in-office with bleaching gels and trays. This concentrated peroxide gel is stronger than that found in at-home kits sold in stores. It will lighten your teeth many shades whiter but will take longer and your dentist will give you a follow-up whitening kit to use at home to complete the treatment.</p>


<h3>Tooth-shaping</h3>
<p>By removing very small amounts of your tooth surface a dentist can change the shape of your teeth. Teeth that are too long or too pointed can be re-shaped into a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. </p>
