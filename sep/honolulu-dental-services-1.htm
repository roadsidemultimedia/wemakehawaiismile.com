<h3>Veneers</h3>
<p><img src="../images/extreme-makeover-2.jpg" alt="Smile Makeover Aiea" class="left" />Of all the methods available today for changing and improving the look of your smile, veneers are among the most popular and successful with our patients. The process involves removing a small amount of tooth structure to make room for the veneers. The dental lab then fabricates the veneers from impressions. After placement, the veneers look like natural teeth. Some advantages of porcelain veneers over bonding include increased longevity, and resistance to staining.</p>

<h3>Full Mouth Makeover</h3>
<p>Full mouth makeover involves restoring the teeth, bite, muscles and self-esteem back to a natural looking and youthful feeling condition. Using computerized technology and an artistic eye, full mouth restoration may be the answer to many problems, such as heat-sensitive teeth, sore jaw muscles, and recurring headaches.</p>

<h3>Crowns</h3>
<p>Many restorations are fabricated using a metal lining covered with porcelain. These types of crowns are used because they are cheap and easy to place in the mouth. They are opaque or flat looking because they do not let light pass through as a natural tooth does. There is often a dark or gray line next to the gum-line. We provide exclusively all porcelain-bonded restorations. When properly placed they are as strong, if not stronger then the porcelain covered metal crowns. Notice the appearance of natural teeth again. Metal-free dentistry can restore your full dentition back to natural form and beauty.</p>

<h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
<p>Teeth whitening or bleaching is one of the most popular areas of cosmetic dentistry. Even subtle changes in shading can make someone look years younger. Several factors can contribute to the darkening of teeth, including the effects of age, certain foods and drinks, smoking, and medications.</p>

<h3>Instant Orthodontics</h3>
<p>Orthodontic braces are most desirable for people under the age of 18. At this stage in life, the bone is more malleable, teeth move easier and are more likely to stay in place once the bone "remodels" around the newly positioned teeth. Many adults also wear braces, however, they are most likely to wear them for a longer period of time, and require a permanent retainer to hold the new positioning. Braces also require numerous office visits in addition to the general hassles of wearing braces. Braces may reposition teeth but will not affect the shape and color of the teeth, which may or may not be desirable.</p>
