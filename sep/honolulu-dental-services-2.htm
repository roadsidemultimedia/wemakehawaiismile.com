<h3>Bridges</h3>
<p><img src="../images/extreme-makeover-1.jpg" alt="Japanese Dentist Honolulu" class="left" />A Bridge is a custom device anchored to neighboring teeth that replaces one or more missing teeth. When a lost tooth is replaced with bridgework, the teeth on either side of the missing one are prepared as crowns to serve as abutments to hold the prosthetic (replacement) tooth in place. Crowns and bridges are most commonly prepared from high quality materials such as semiprecious or precious metals, porcelain, or a fused combination of the two. Aesthetics, function, and tissue compatibility are considered when selecting the material most suitable for you.</p>

<h3>Non-metal Fillings</h3>
<p>Until recently, dental patients have been told that repairing teeth with white fillings was just for cosmetic purposes, and white fillings may not be as durable as the metal restorations. This philosophy is now passé. With the modern technologies of dental adhesion, resins, lasers, and state-of-art ceramics, the new porcelain restorations are close to rivaling nature in strength, wear, function, and appearance. There are now sixteen-year studies showing that with properly administered technique, these advanced restorations surpass traditional dentistry. With these new materials, it is possible to bond teeth back together, virtually restoring them back to their virgin strength without the invasiveness of full-coverage crowns. In the majority of circumstances, metal fillings or crowns can be replaced with techniques that are more conservative. It is therefore possible to preserve the healthy, remaining tooth structure, rather than whittling teeth down, as a pencil would be ground away by a pencil sharpener.</p>


<h3>Smile Design</h3>
<p>Smile Design is a conservative, non-aggressive way to rejuvenate your smile. Veneers work well for tooth reshaping and resizing. Veneers are an attractive way to improve your smile because they achieve a very natural look with a very conservative tooth preparation (shaping).  Very little natural tooth structure is removed when veneers are bonded into place and the virgin strength of the tooth is recaptured as well. We have found that this is the treatment of choice for smile enhancement if more than whitening is needed..</p>

<h3>Bonding</h3>
<p>The application of tooth colored filling material (composite) to the teeth has been a dental technique for many years. Recent advances have increased the strength, durability, and longevity of these restorations. Bonding material can be molded and shaped to achieve outstanding results including tooth lightening, closing spaces between teeth, making teeth appear straighter, and repairing chips and cracks. When polished it gives the appearance of natural tooth structure.</p>
